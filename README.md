# DAGL - A digital monument to bad decisions

You've stumbled upon something you shouldn't have. This isn't a project; it's a crime scene. This repository is the digital manifest of 134 burner Cursor accounts, each a testament to the poor financial decisions of a few known individuals who, we can only assume, lost a very, very stupid bet.

## A Story

It all started on a Tuesday. The year was 1996. A programmer, let's call him "Dave," fueled by nothing but Jolt Cola, lukewarm hot pockets, and what his colleagues nervously referred to as "a pharmaceutical adventure," was tasked with building a game client. Dave was a pioneer, a visionary, a man who looked at the concept of "best practices" and decided to do the exact opposite. He wrote code with the frantic, chaotic energy of a man trying to explain quantum physics to a hamster after a three-day meth binge. The result was Dark Ages.

Fast forward two decades. A shadowy cabal of nostalgic, wealthy lunatics decided the world needed this masterpiece back. They funded a team of 134 poor souls—one for each burner account—to embark on a digital archaeological dig. Their mission: to reverse-engineer Dave's magnum opus and bring it into the modern age.

They should have left it buried.

What they found was horrifying. The network protocol was written in a language that only Cthulhu could love. The rendering engine was held together with digital duct tape and prayers. And deep within the character animation module, they found a single, desperate comment, apparently from a developer who had tried to fix one of Dave's bugs back in '98:

> `// 72 hours. 72 hours I've been staring at this memory leak. My brain don't work, my dick don't work, and neither does this goddamn code. I quit. Tell my wife I love her.`

We tried to rewrite it. We really did. We tried to sanitize the eldritch horror that Dave had unleashed upon the world. But the curse is too strong. The spaghetti code is a hydra; for every plate you untangle, two more appear, somehow more twisted than the last.

## Do NOT Use This Code

This is not a library. This is a warning. It is a total pile of crap, lovingly reverse-engineered and then haphazardly slapped together. Using this code for any purpose is an invitation for suffering. Your servers will crash. Your users will revolt. You will develop a nervous twitch and a drinking problem.

Go outside. Touch grass. Call your mother. Do literally anything else. You have been warned.
